# memoryGame-maps

Memory game with 2 difficulties that were implemented with collectionViewController and CollectionViewCell, popout to enter player name when game ends and top Ten scoreboard
that has both TableView and containerView that contains googlemaps View


added pod 'GoogleMaps', '5.0.0' to the pod file which helped me import googleMaps and implement their map in my application
for more information open https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/start
just for the sake of showing I disabled the shuffle option for the cards
